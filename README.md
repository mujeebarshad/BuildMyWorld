# RoboND-Term1-P1-Build-My-World
Project 1 of Udacity Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree Program

## Overview  
In this project you'll create your simulation world in Gazebo for all your upcoming projects in the [Udacity Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/robotics-software-engineer--nd209).  
1. Build a single floor wall structure using the **Building Editor** tool in Gazebo. Apply at least one feature, one color, and optionally one texture to your structure. Make sure there's enough space between the walls for a robot to navigate.  
2. Model any object of your choice using the **Model Editor** tool in Gazebo. Your model links should be connected with joints.  
3. Import your structure and two instances of your model inside an empty **Gazebo World**.  
4. Import at least one model from the **Gazebo online library** and implement it in your existing Gazebo world.  
5. Write a C++ **World Plugin** to interact with your world. Your code should display “Welcome to ’s World!” message as soon as you launch the Gazebo world file.
